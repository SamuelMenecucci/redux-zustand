# Redux-Zustand

Project developed in Ignite classes, from Rocketseat, to study the use of the Redux + Redux toolkit and Zustand, with unit tests included for the stores.

Application simulates a video player, separating classes into modules. When you click on a class, it will start in the application's player, with the ability to play the next video as soon as the previous one ends.
The class data is inside the json-server, to simulate a request to an API.

Initially it was developed with Redux + Redux Tollkit for state management, and later it was refactored to use Zustand.

It has comments in the code for better explanation and understanding.
